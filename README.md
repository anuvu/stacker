# stacker [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/anuvu/stacker.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/anuvu/stacker)

Stacker is a tool for building OCI images via a declarative yaml format.

### Building

Stacker requires go 1.9, on Ubuntu you can get that with:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:gophers/archive
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install golang-1.9
    export PATH=$PATH:/usr/lib/go-1.9/bin

And uses glide for dependency management, which unfortunately is installed with
curl piped to sh as follows:

    curl https://glide.sh/get | sh

Stacker also has the following build dependencies:

    sudo apt install lxc-dev libacl1-dev

And a few runtime dependencies as well:

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:projectatomic/ppa
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install skopeo
    go install github.com/openSUSE/umoci

Finally, once you have the dependencies, stacker can be built with a simple
`make`. The stacker binary will be output to `$GOPATH/bin/stacker`.

### Testing

The test suite requires `jq`, which can be installed on Ubuntu:

    sudo apt install jq

And `umoci`, which can be installed with:

    go get github.com/openSUSE/umoci/cmd/umoci

And can be run with

    cd test
    sudo -E ./main.sh

It will exit 0 on failure. There are several environment variables available:

1. `STACKER_KEEP` keeps the base layers and files, so you don't need to keep
   downloading them
1. `STACKER_INSPECT` stops the test suite before cleanup, so you can inspect
   the failure

### BTRFS

If you are running in a btrfs filesystem, nothing needs to be done.

If you are running in a non-btrfs filesystem, but as root, then stacker
will automatically create and mount a loopback btrfs to use.

If you are running as non-root in a non-btrfs filesystem, then you need
to prepare by, with privilege, mounting a btrfs under "./roots" first.
You can see this being done in tests/main.sh:

```bash
truncate -s 100G btrfs.loop
mkfs.btrfs btrfs.loop
mkdir -p roots
sudo mount -o loop,user_subvol_rm_allowed btrfs.loop roots
sudo chown -R $(id -u):$(id -g) roots
```

### Kernel Version

To use unprivileged stacker, you will need a kernel with user namespaces
enabled (>= 3.10). However, many features related to user namespaces have
landed since then, so it is best to use the most up to date kernel. For example
user namespaced file capabilities were introduced in kernel commit 8db6c34f1db,
which landed in 4.14-rc1. Stock rhel/centos images use file capabilities to
avoid making executables like ping setuid, and so unprivileged stacker will
need a >= 4.14 kernel to work with these images. Fortunately, the Ubuntu
kernels have these patches backported, so any ubuntu >= 16.04 will work.

### The `stacker.yaml` file

The basic driver of stacker is the stackerfile, canonically named
`stacker.yaml`. The stackerfile describes a set of OCI manifests to build. For
example:

	centos:
		from:
			type: docker
			url: docker://centos:latest
		run: echo meshuggah rocks > /etc/motd

Describes a manifest which is the latest Centos image from the Docker hub.
There are various other directives which users can use to 

1. `from`: this describes the base image that stacker will start from. You can
   either start from some other image in the same stackerfile, a Docker image,
   or a tarball.
1. `import`: A set of files to download or copy into the container. Stacker
   will put these files at `/stacker`, which will be automatically cleaned up
   after the commands in the `run` section are run and the image is finalized.
   URLs (`http://example.com/file.txt`), files (`/path/to/file`), and files
   from other stacker layers (`stacker:///output/my.exe`) are all supported.
1. `run`: This is the set of commands to run in order to build the image; they
   are run in a user namespaced container, with the set of files imported
   available in `/stacker`.
1. `environment`, `labels`, `working_dir`, `volumes`, `cmd`, `entrypoint`:
   these all correspond exactly to the similarly named bits in the [OCI image
   config spec](https://github.com/opencontainers/image-spec/blob/master/config.md#properties),
   and are available for users to pass things through to the runtime environment
   of the image.
1. `full_command`: because of the odd behavior of `cmd` and `entrypoint` (and
   the inherited nature of these from previous stacker layers), `full_command`
   provides a way to set the full command that will be executed in the image,
   clearing out any previous `cmd` and `entrypoint` values that were set in the
   image.
1. `build_only`: indicates whether or not to include this layer in the final
   OCI image. This can be useful in conjunction with an import from this layer
   in another image, if you want to isolate the build environment for a binary
   but not include all of its build dependencies.
